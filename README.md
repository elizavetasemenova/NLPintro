# NLPintro


### What
~~~
Material for the workshop **NLP with Python (an Introduction)**, 7th October 2018, Zurich.

https://www.meetup.com/NLP-Zurich/events/254827226/
~~~

### Description
~~~
This workshop will cover the tools which will help you to quickly make sense of the large streams of text and voice information. It will be built progressively to give you a fair understating of the machinery behind the scenes: we will start with an introduction to machine learning in the context of natural language processing, and move to neural networks, and learn how to apply modern NLP libraries. Real-life examples will include speech-to-text, information retrieval, and text summarization.
~~~

### Prerequisites
~~~
We expect that you have some background in programming, preferrably in Python. Knowledge of linear algebra and basic calculus is necessary to understand the part of machine learning and deep learning. Other than that, please bring your good mood and curiosity!
